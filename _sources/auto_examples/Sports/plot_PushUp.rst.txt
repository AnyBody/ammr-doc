Push Up
===============================

A full-body model doing push-ups with assumed drivers.

**Main file:** ``Application/Examples/PushUp/PushUp.main.any``

The model displays several topics

-Block building techniques
-Include files
-Structuring of models using directories

The positions of the hands can be controlled by chaning variables in the file
Environment.any

.. caution:: The model seems to be too weak for the load applied when doing pushups, this
  is a sign that the shoulder needs more adjustments before it becomes reliable
