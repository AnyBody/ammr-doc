Pedel demo simple
===============================

This model demonstrates the construction
of a foot pedal example.

**Main file:** ``Application/Examples/PedalDemo/PedalDemo.Main.any``

This model is for design of a pedal that is comfortable to use 
for a seated operator depending on the stiffness of the embedded
spring and the distance of the seat from the pedal.
