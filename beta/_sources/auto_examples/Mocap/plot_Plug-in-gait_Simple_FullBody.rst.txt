Simple Full body model
===============================

Example of full body MoCap model using the Plug-in-Gait marker protocol, and
walking on three typ4 force platforms. The model is fairly simple and a good
starting point for new users. If you plan to have many trials/subjects, take
a look at the example which better support multiple trails.
