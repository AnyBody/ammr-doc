Contribute to Model Development
-------------------------------

The development version of the Model Repository is a collaboration between AnyBody Technology,
and many academic institutions and research projects. 

If you are interested in beta models/repositories you can get access to the
development version of the AMMR. Development takes place in a semi-closed
repository. The repository is kept private to protect academic contributors who also
often need to publish their models before release.

However, access to the repository is given on request. Please submit a issue to this repository requesting access:

1. Goto to https://github.com/AnyBody/ammr-doc/issues

2. Create an issue to request acess.
